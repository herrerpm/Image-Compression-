     * The colorSimilarity method analyzes the similarity between two
     * colors by getting the absolute difference between each of the channels.
     * After getting this values they are then averaged and an arbitrary threshold
     * is permitted. The threshold ranges from 0 to 1, and the lower the threshold
     * permitted the higher fidelity the compressed image will have. This is useful as
     * certain images donÂ´t require such quality, and they can be encoded with fewer bytes
     * however, images with gradients for example would need more bytes to be
     * represented correctly. This function defaults the threshold to 0.0039, which is
     * guaranteed to give quality images while compressing the image.
